description: A collection of small tools for Minecraft content development
---
<p>Toolets is a collection of small tools for Minecraft content development. Originally starting as a command line version of the <a href="{% capture selarealink %}{% link selarea/index.html %}{% endcapture %}/toolets{{ selarealink | remove_first: "/toolets" }}">Selection Area</a> tool, toolets has since grown to the website you see today.</p>

<p>All of the tools are written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with templating written with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> to ensure consistency between different tools on the site. Styling as a whole uses <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, with some customisation using Sass.</p>

<p>The website's code is available on <a href="https://github.com/JamesMCo/toolets">GitHub</a>, and if you find any bugs or have any feature requests, I'd love to hear about them on the <a href="https://github.com/JamesMCo/toolets/issues">Issues</a> page.
